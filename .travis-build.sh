## Tests
# The JDK was built above; there is no need to rebuild it again.
# Don't use "-d" to debug ant, because that results in a log so long
# that Travis truncates the log and terminates the job.
# Comment this out since it causes a crash.
# ant tests-nobuildjdk

## test that Travis doesn't crash on
# Run framework tests.
(cd framework && ant all-tests-nojtreg-nobuild)

# Also runs framework jtreg-tests

# If too many checker tests are run, the tests crash, so run one.

# It's cheaper to run the demos test here than to trigger the
